# 02 — Data Model (Postgres 16)

All timestamps UTC. All agent payloads JSONB validated against `packages/schemas`.
Every table below carries `org_id` (FK → `orgs.id`, NOT NULL) — SaaS-readiness rule 1
(docs/00-vision.md). T-102 seeded a single default org and backfilled every existing
row to it; real per-request org resolution, invites, per-org RBAC, quotas, and staff
impersonation auditing are T-201.

## orgs
`id (PK), name, created_at, max_parallel_tickets, llm_fallback_order` — the tenant.
`max_parallel_tickets` (nullable = unlimited, T-201) is the one quota that's actually
enforced today — sandbox-minutes/day and storage caps from SPEC-201's wording have no
real usage metering to enforce against yet (`apps/sandbox` isn't wired to the dev-agent
path, T-105's own disclosed gap), so no column exists for them. `llm_fallback_order`
(T-202, nullable JSONB array of provider names e.g. `["anthropic", "openai"]`) is the
org's BYOK provider priority order — a single small setting, not a separate ordering
table (same judgment as `max_parallel_tickets`); `None`/empty means "whatever
`provider_keys` rows exist, anthropic first".

## org_members (T-201)
`id, org_id (FK orgs), user_email (FK users.email), role (user_role enum), created_at`
— unique on `(org_id, user_email)`. A user's role is per-org now, not global; replaces
the old `users.role`/`users.org_id` pair. `user_role` is `owner | approver | member |
viewer` (renamed from T-102-era `admin/approver/viewer` — `admin` → `owner`, `member`
is new).

## org_invites (T-201)
`id, org_id, email, role, invited_by, token (unique), status (pending|accepted|
revoked), created_at, accepted_at` — an owner-issued invite. No email-sending exists in
this system yet, so the acceptance token is returned directly in the invite-creation
API response (a real deployment would email a link instead).

## staff_audit_log (T-201 AC5)
`id, staff_email, org_id, action, path (nullable), ts` — one row per platform-staff
impersonation action: `impersonate_start` when a "view as org" session begins, and one
`page_view` row (with `path`) per page the frontend visits while impersonating.

## provider_keys (T-202)
`id, org_id (FK orgs), provider, last4, status (active|invalid|revoked), created_at,
created_by, rotated_at (nullable)` — unique on `(org_id, provider)`. Audit-only
metadata for an org's BYOK provider key; the secret itself lives ONLY in Vault at
`tenants/<org_id>/llm/<provider>`, never in this table, a log, an event, or a trace.
`status` drives dispatch: only `active` keys are ever returned by the runtime-keys
resolution endpoint agents fetch from at run start — a `revoked`/`invalid` key drops
out immediately, the enforcement behind SPEC-202 AC6's "paused within 60s" (every
dispatch re-fetches fresh, so there's no cache to go stale).

## provider_eval_opt_ins (T-202 AC5)
`id, org_id (FK orgs), agent_role, provider, opted_in_by, ts` — unique on `(org_id,
agent_role, provider)`. An org's explicit opt-in to dispatch a (role, provider) combo
that has no green eval floor yet ("unverified quality"). A standing, org-level
decision — distinct from `ticket_events` (ticket-scoped) and `staff_audit_log` (a
staff action).

## tickets
| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | text PK | `T-001` style, human-readable |
| org_id | text FK→orgs | tenant (T-102) |
| type | enum | `idea` \| `epic` \| `task` |
| parent_id | text FK→tickets | ideas parent epics parent tasks |
| state | enum | see 03-state-machine.md |
| title | text | |
| spec | jsonb | TaskSpec for tasks, BusinessCase for ideas |
| acceptance_criteria | jsonb | array of machine-checkable criteria |
| assignee_agent | text | agent role id, nullable |
| budget_usd | numeric | hard cap; running spend is `cost_ledger`'s sum for the ticket, not a column here |
| bounce_count | int | max 3 then `escalated` |
| created_by | text | user id or agent id |
| created_at | timestamptz | ticket creation time; Phase 1 tickets start in `ready`, so this doubles as the "ready" timestamp for the cycle-time metric (docs/00-vision.md) |

## ticket_events (append-only, partitioned monthly)
| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | bigserial PK | |
| ticket_id | text FK | |
| ts | timestamptz | |
| actor | text | `agent:dev-1` \| `human:uid` \| `system` |
| kind | enum | `message` \| `tool_call` \| `test_result` \| `transition` \| `cost` \| `edit` (T-103: human edits to a Planner-produced TaskSpec, before/after payload) \| `assignment` (T-104: Delivery Manager decision + reason + profiles considered) \| `review` (T-106: Review agent verdict + comments + scope_violations) |
| payload | jsonb | |

## agent_runs
one row per agent invocation: `id, ticket_id, agent_role, model, started_at, ended_at,
status, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd, trace_id, prompt_version, provider` (links to
Langfuse). `agent_role` is the dev agent's assigned capability-registry profile id
(`dev-frontend`/`dev-backend`/`dev-devops`/`dev-generalist`) when one was assigned,
else the generic role (`planner`/`review`/`delivery-manager`/`dev`) — this doubles as
the "spend by profile" dimension (T-108). `prompt_version` is parsed from the agent's
own prompt file's `# ... · vX.Y` header at run time; `null` for runs that predate T-108.
`provider` (T-202, nullable — `null` for runs that predate BYOK) is which provider
actually served the run (`anthropic`/`openai`), dynamic now instead of the old
hard-coded `"anthropic"` literal.

## cost_ledger
`id, ticket_id, agent_run_id, provider, model, usd, ts` — source of truth for $/ticket.
`provider` (real since T-202 — previously always the literal `"anthropic"`) is the
provider that actually served the run, threaded from `agent_runs.provider`.

## cost rollups (T-108)
No new tables — `GET /tickets/{id}/cost-rollup` sums `cost_ledger` over a ticket and
every descendant (`ticket_repository.get_descendants`, walking `parent_id`), closing
the idea-drawer rollup gap. `GET /dashboard/spend-by-profile` and
`GET /dashboard/spend-by-prompt-version` group `cost_ledger` by `agent_runs.agent_role`
and `agent_runs.prompt_version` respectively — the org-level "spend by model & agent
role" view originally promised in SPEC-006 but never built until now. Eval harness
runs (`apps/orchestrator/.../evals/`) never call the ticket API or write `agent_runs`/
`cost_ledger` rows, so these metrics are ticket-work-only by construction (T-108 adds a
regression test for this).

## approvals
`id, ticket_id, gate (idea|budget|deploy|escalation|review), decided_by, decision, note, ts`.

## merge_queue_entries (T-107)
`id, ticket_id, repo, status (queued|merged|conflict), enqueued_at, resolved_at` — one
FIFO slot per ticket whose CI went green. `in_qa -> done` requires a `merged` row here;
CI-green alone only creates a `queued` one. Written by `apps/orchestrator`'s
`merge_queue.py` after a real rebase-and-retest, not by the CI webhook directly.

## artifacts
`id, ticket_id, kind (diff|ci_log|trace|coverage), s3_key, ts`.

## users
`email (PK), is_platform_staff, created_at` — OIDC-authenticated humans (SPEC-006). A
global identity table only — role and org membership live on `org_members` (T-201),
not here. First login auto-joins the seeded default org as `viewer` unless the email
is pre-seeded via `ADMIN_EMAILS` (→ `owner`) or the user already has a membership from
an accepted invite. `is_platform_staff` (bootstrapped via `PLATFORM_STAFF_EMAILS`,
mirroring `ADMIN_EMAILS`'s pattern) is a separate, cross-org concept — staff
impersonation, not an org role.

## escaped_defect_reports
`id, ticket_id, note, reported_by, ts` — manual entry feeding the pilot dashboard's
"escaped defects" metric (docs/00-vision.md); a defect found after a ticket reached
`done` that QA didn't catch.

## Rules
- No updates or deletes on `ticket_events` and `cost_ledger` — append-only, enforced by
  DB grants.
- Every state change writes a `transition` event in the same DB transaction.
